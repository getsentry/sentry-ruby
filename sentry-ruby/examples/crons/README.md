# sentry-ruby Crons example

Crons monitoring allows you to track that certain that should be performed
on a certain schedule are indeed performed on time and without errors. See 
[documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/ruby/crons/) for more details.

This example project has a few rake tasks that manually send monitor check-ins
to Sentry.
