The official Ruby-language client and integration layer for the [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) error reporting API.

## Getting Started

### Install

```ruby
gem "sentry-ruby"
gem "sentry-good_job"
```

Then you're all set! `sentry-good_job` will automatically capture exceptions from your ActiveJob workers when using Good Job as the backend!

## Features

- **Automatic Error Capture**: Captures exceptions from ActiveJob workers using Good Job
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks job execution times and performance metrics
- **Cron Monitoring**: Automatic setup for scheduled jobs with cron monitoring
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains user context and trace propagation across job executions
- **Configurable Reporting**: Control when errors are reported (after retries, only dead jobs, etc.)
- **Rails Integration**: Seamless integration with Rails applications

## Configuration

The integration can be configured through Sentry's configuration:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = 'your-dsn-here'
  
  # Good Job specific configuration
  config.good_job.enable_cron_monitors = true
  
  # ActiveJob configuration (handled by sentry-rails)
  config.rails.active_job_report_on_retry_error = false
  config.send_default_pii = false  # Controls job arguments inclusion
end
```

### Configuration Options

#### Good Job Specific Options

- `enable_cron_monitors` (default: `true`): Enable cron monitoring for scheduled jobs

#### ActiveJob Options (handled by sentry-rails)

- `config.rails.active_job_report_on_retry_error` (default: `false`): Only report errors after all retry attempts are exhausted
- `config.send_default_pii` (default: `false`): Include job arguments in error context (be careful with sensitive data)

**Note**: The Good Job integration now leverages sentry-rails for core ActiveJob functionality, including trace propagation, user context preservation, and error reporting. This provides better integration and reduces duplication.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

The integration works automatically once installed. It will:

1. Capture exceptions from ActiveJob workers
2. Set up performance monitoring for job execution
3. Automatically configure cron monitoring for scheduled jobs
4. Preserve user context and trace propagation

### Automatic Setup

The integration works automatically once installed. It will:

1. **Capture exceptions** from ActiveJob workers using sentry-rails
2. **Set up performance monitoring** for job execution with enhanced GoodJob-specific metrics
3. **Automatically configure cron monitoring** for scheduled jobs
4. **Preserve user context and trace propagation** across job executions
5. **Add GoodJob-specific context** including queue name, executions, priority, and latency

### Cron Monitoring

For scheduled jobs, cron monitoring is automatically set up based on your Good Job configuration:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.good_job.cron = {
  'my_scheduled_job' => {
    class: 'MyScheduledJob',
    cron: '0 * * * *' # Every hour
  }
}
```

You can also manually set up cron monitoring:

```ruby
class MyScheduledJob < ApplicationJob
  sentry_cron_monitor "0 * * * *", timezone: "UTC"
end
```

### Custom Error Handling

The integration respects ActiveJob's retry configuration and will only report errors based on your settings:

```ruby
class MyJob < ApplicationJob
  retry_on StandardError, wait: :exponentially_longer, attempts: 3
  
  def perform
    # This will only be reported to Sentry after 3 attempts if active_job_report_on_retry_error is true
    raise "Something went wrong"
  end
end
```

### Debugging and Detailed Logging

The integration uses the standard Sentry SDK logger (`Sentry.configuration.sdk_logger`) for all logging needs. You can configure this logger to get detailed information about what the integration is doing:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = 'your-dsn-here'
  
  # Configure the SDK logger for debugging
  config.sdk_logger = Logger.new($stdout)
  config.sdk_logger.level = Logger::DEBUG

  # Or use Rails logger with debug level
  # config.sdk_logger = Rails.logger
  # config.sdk_logger.level = Logger::DEBUG
end
```

#### Custom Logger Configuration

For more advanced logging needs, you can provide a custom logger:

```ruby
# Custom logger with specific formatting
custom_logger = Logger.new('log/sentry-good_job.log')
custom_logger.formatter = proc do |severity, datetime, progname, msg|
  "[#{datetime}] #{severity}: #{msg}\n"
end

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = 'your-dsn-here'
  config.sdk_logger = custom_logger
  config.sdk_logger.level = Logger::INFO
end
```

#### Log Levels

The integration logs at different levels:
- **INFO**: Integration setup, cron monitoring configuration, job monitoring setup
- **WARN**: Configuration issues, missing job classes, cron parsing errors
- **DEBUG**: Detailed execution flow (when debug level is enabled)

#### What Gets Logged

When logging is enabled, you'll see information about:
- Job execution start and completion
- Error capture and reporting decisions
- Cron monitoring setup and configuration
- Performance metrics collection
- GoodJob-specific context enhancement
- Integration initialization and setup

## Performance Monitoring

When performance monitoring is enabled, the integration will track:

- Job execution time
- Queue latency (GoodJob-specific)
- Retry counts
- Job context and metadata
- GoodJob-specific metrics (queue name, executions, priority)

## Error Context

The integration automatically adds relevant context to error reports:

- Job class name
- Job ID
- Queue name (GoodJob-specific)
- Execution count (GoodJob-specific)
- Priority (GoodJob-specific)
- Enqueued and scheduled timestamps
- Job arguments (if enabled via send_default_pii)
- Latency metrics (GoodJob-specific)

## Compatibility

- Ruby 2.4+
- Rails 5.2+
- Good Job 3.0+
- Sentry Ruby SDK 5.28.0+
