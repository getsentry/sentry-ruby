  - Fixes [#956](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/956) and [#1629](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1629)

## 4.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Merge context with the same key instead of replacing the old value. [#1621](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1621)
  - Fixes [#1619](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1619)
- Fix `HTTPTransport`'s `ssl` configuration [#1626](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1626)
- Log errors happened in `BackgroundWorker#perform` [#1624](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1624)
  - Fixes [#1618](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1618)
- Gracefully shutdown background worker before the process exits [#1617](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1617)
  - Fixes [#1612](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1612)

### Refactoring

- Extract envelope construction logic from Transport [#1616](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1616)
- Add frozen string literal comment to sentry-ruby [#1623](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1623)

## 4.8.0

### Features

- Support exception frame's local variable capturing
  - [#1580](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1580)
  - [#1589](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1589)

  **Example**:

  <img width="80%" alt="locals capturing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5079556/134694936-8c42ca09-870a-4587-b1ff-e8ddd79d2ce7.png">

  To enable this feature, you need to set `config.capture_exception_frame_locals` to `true`:

  ```rb
  Sentry.init do |config|
    config.capture_exception_frame_locals = true # default is false
  end
  ```

  This feature should only introduce negligible performance overhead in most Ruby applications. But if you notice obvious performance regression, please file an issue and we'll investigate it.

- Support `ActiveStorage` spans in tracing events [#1588](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1588)
- Support `Sidekiq` Tags in Sentry [#1596](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1596)
- Add Client Reports to collect dropped event statistics [#1604](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1604)

  This feature reports statistics about dropped events along with sent events (so no additional requests made). It'll help Sentry improve SDKs and features like rate-limiting. This information will not be visible to users at the moment, but we're planning to add this information to user-facing UI.

  If you **don't** want to send this data, you can opt-out by setting `config.send_client_reports = false`.

### Bug Fixes

- Connect `Sidekiq`'s transaction with its parent when possible [#1590](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1590)
  - Fixes [#1586](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1586)
- Use nil instead of false to disable callable settings [#1594](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1594)
- Avoid duplicated sampling on Transaction events [#1601](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1601)
- Remove verbose data from `#inspect` result [#1602](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1602)

### Refactoring

### Features

- Add `sentry-resque` [#1476](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1476)
- Add tracing support to `sentry-resque` [#1480](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1480)

- Add tracing support to `sentry-delayed_job` [#1482](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1482)

**IMPORTANT**

If your application processes a large number of background jobs and has tracing enabled, it is recommended to check your `traces_sampler` (or switch to `traces_sampler`) and give the background job operations a smaller rate:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |sampling_context|
    transaction_context = sampling_context[:transaction_context]
    op = transaction_context[:op]

    case op
    when /request/
      # sampling for requests
      0.1
    when /delayed_job/ # or resque
      0.001 # adjust this value
    else
      0.0 # ignore all other transactions
    end
  end
end
```

This is to prevent the background job tracing consumes too much of your transaction quota.

### Bug Fixes

  - Fixes [#1475](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1475) and [#1303](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1303)

## 4.5.2

## 4.5.1

### Bug Fixes

- Remove response from breadcrumb and span [#1463](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1463)
  - Fixes the issue mentioned in this [comment](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1199#issuecomment-773069840)

- Limit breadcrumb's message length [#1465](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1465)

## 4.5.0

### Features

- Implement sentry-trace propagation [#1446](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1446)

The SDK will insert the `sentry-trace` to outgoing requests made with `Net::HTTP`. Its value would look like `d827317d25d5420aa3aa97a0257db998-57757614642bdff5-1`.

If the receiver service also uses Sentry and the SDK supports performance monitoring, its tracing event will be connected with the sender application's.

Example:

<img width="1283" alt="connect sentry trace" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5079556/118963250-d7b40980-b998-11eb-9de4-598d1b220137.png">

This feature is activated by default. But users can use the new `config.propagate_traces` config option to disable it.

- Add configuration option `skip_rake_integration` [#1453](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1453)

With this new option, users can skip exceptions reported from rake tasks by setting it `true`. Default is `false`.

### Bug Fixes

- Allow toggling background sending on the fly [#1447](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1447)
- Disable background worker for runner mode [#1448](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1448)
  - Fixes [#1324](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1324)
