## 5.0.1

- Don't reuse Net::HTTP objects in `HTTPTransport` [#1696](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1696)

## 5.0.0

### Breaking Change - Goodbye `faraday` ðŸ‘‹ 

**TL;DR: If you are already on version `4.9` and do not use `config.transport.http_adapter` and `config.transport.faraday_builder`, you don't need to change anything.**

This version removes the dependency of [faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday) and replaces related implementation with the `Net::HTTP` standard library. 


#### Why?

Since the old `sentry-raven` SDK, we've been using `faraday` as the HTTP client for years (see [HTTPTransport](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/blob/4-9/sentry-ruby/lib/sentry/transport/http_transport.rb)). It's an amazing tool that saved us many work and allowed us to focus on SDK features. 

But because many users also use `faraday` themselves and have their own version requirements, managing this dependency has become harder over the past few years. Just to list a few related issues:

- [#944](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/944)
- [#1424](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1424)
- [#1524](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1524)

And with the release of [faraday 2.0](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday/releases/tag/v2.0.0), we could only imagine it getting even more difficult (which it kind of did, see [#1663](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1663)).

So we think it's time to say goodbye to it with this release.


#### What's changed?


By default, the SDK used `faraday`'s `net_http` adapter, which is also built on top of `Net::HTTP`. So this change shouldn't impact most of the users.

The only noticeable changes are the removal of 2 faraday-specific transport configurations:

- `config.transport.http_adapter`
- `config.transport.faraday_builder`

**If you are already on version `4.9` and do not use those configuration options, it'll be as simple as `bundle update`.**

#### What if I still want to use `faraday` to send my events?

`sentry-ruby` already allows users to set a custom transport class with:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.transport.transport_class = MyTransportClass
end
```

So to use a faraday-based transport, you can:

1. Build a `FaradayTransport` like this:

```rb
require 'sentry/transport/http_transport'
require 'faraday'

class FaradayTransport < Sentry::HTTPTransport
  attr_reader :adapter

  def initialize(*args)
    @adapter = :net_http
    super
  end

  def send_data(data)
    encoding = ""

    if should_compress?(data)
      data = Zlib.gzip(data)
      encoding = GZIP_ENCODING
    end

    response = conn.post @endpoint do |req|
      req.headers['Content-Type'] = CONTENT_TYPE
      req.headers['Content-Encoding'] = encoding
      req.headers['X-Sentry-Auth'] = generate_auth_header
      req.body = data
    end

    if has_rate_limited_header?(response.headers)
      handle_rate_limited_response(response.headers)
    end
  rescue Faraday::Error => e
    error_info = e.message

    if e.response
      if e.response[:status] == 429
        handle_rate_limited_response(e.response[:headers])
      else
        error_info += "\nbody: #{e.response[:body]}"
        error_info += " Error in headers is: #{e.response[:headers]['x-sentry-error']}" if e.response[:headers]['x-sentry-error']
      end
    end

    raise Sentry::ExternalError, error_info
  end

  private

  def set_conn
    server = @dsn.server

    log_debug("Sentry HTTP Transport connecting to #{server}")

    Faraday.new(server, :ssl => ssl_configuration, :proxy => @transport_configuration.proxy) do |builder|
      builder.response :raise_error
      builder.options.merge! faraday_opts
      builder.headers[:user_agent] = "sentry-ruby/#{Sentry::VERSION}"
      builder.adapter(*adapter)
    end
  end

  def faraday_opts
    [:timeout, :open_timeout].each_with_object({}) do |opt, memo|
      memo[opt] = @transport_configuration.public_send(opt) if @transport_configuration.public_send(opt)
    end
  end

  def ssl_configuration
    {
      verify: @transport_configuration.ssl_verification,
      ca_file: @transport_configuration.ssl_ca_file
    }.merge(@transport_configuration.ssl || {})
  end
end
```

2. Set `config.transport.transport = FaradayTransport`


**Please keep in mind that this may not work in the future when the SDK changes its `HTTPTransport` implementation.**

## 4.8.1

### Bug Fixes

- Merge context with the same key instead of replacing the old value. [#1621](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1621)
  - Fixes [#1619](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1619)

## 4.8.0

### Features

- Support exception frame's local variable capturing
  - [#1580](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1580)
  - [#1589](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1589)

  **Example**:

  <img width="80%" alt="locals capturing" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5079556/134694936-8c42ca09-870a-4587-b1ff-e8ddd79d2ce7.png">

  To enable this feature, you need to set `config.capture_exception_frame_locals` to `true`:

  ```rb
  Sentry.init do |config|
    config.capture_exception_frame_locals = true # default is false
  end
  ```

  This feature should only introduce negligible performance overhead in most Ruby applications. But if you notice obvious performance regression, please file an issue and we'll investigate it.

- Support `ActiveStorage` spans in tracing events [#1588](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1588)
- Support `Sidekiq` Tags in Sentry [#1596](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1596)
- Add Client Reports to collect dropped event statistics [#1604](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1604)

  This feature reports statistics about dropped events along with sent events (so no additional requests made). It'll help Sentry improve SDKs and features like rate-limiting. This information will not be visible to users at the moment, but we're planning to add this information to user-facing UI.

  If you **don't** want to send this data, you can opt-out by setting `config.send_client_reports = false`.

### Bug Fixes

- Connect `Sidekiq`'s transaction with its parent when possible [#1590](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1590)
  - Fixes [#1586](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1586)
- Use nil instead of false to disable callable settings [#1594](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1594)
- Avoid duplicated sampling on Transaction events [#1601](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1601)
- Remove verbose data from `#inspect` result [#1602](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1602)

### Refactoring

- Move Sentry::Rails::CaptureExceptions before ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions [#1608](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1608)
- Refactor `Sentry::Configuration` [#1595](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1595)

## 4.6.0

### Features

- Add `sentry-resque` [#1476](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1476)
- Add tracing support to `sentry-resque` [#1480](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1480)
- Set user to the current scope via sidekiq middleware [#1469](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1469)
- Add tracing support to `sentry-delayed_job` [#1482](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1482)

**IMPORTANT**

If your application processes a large number of background jobs and has tracing enabled, it is recommended to check your `traces_sampler` (or switch to `traces_sampler`) and give the background job operations a smaller rate:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |sampling_context|
    transaction_context = sampling_context[:transaction_context]
    op = transaction_context[:op]

    case op
    when /request/
      # sampling for requests
      0.1
    when /delayed_job/ # or resque
      0.001 # adjust this value
    else
      0.0 # ignore all other transactions
    end
  end
end
```

This is to prevent the background job tracing consumes too much of your transaction quota.

### Bug Fixes

- Force encode request body if it's a string [#1484](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1484)
  - Fixes [#1475](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1475) and [#1303](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1303)

## 4.5.2

### Refactoring

- Remove redundant files [#1477](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1477)

### Bug Fixes

- Disable release detection when SDK is not configured to send events [#1471](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1471)
  - Fixes [#885](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/885)

## 4.5.1

### Bug Fixes

- Remove response from breadcrumb and span [#1463](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1463)
  - Fixes the issue mentioned in this [comment](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1199#issuecomment-773069840)

- Limit breadcrumb's message length [#1465](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1465)

## 4.5.0

### Features

- Implement sentry-trace propagation [#1446](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1446)

The SDK will insert the `sentry-trace` to outgoing requests made with `Net::HTTP`. Its value would look like `d827317d25d5420aa3aa97a0257db998-57757614642bdff5-1`.

If the receiver service also uses Sentry and the SDK supports performance monitoring, its tracing event will be connected with the sender application's.

Example:

<img width="1283" alt="connect sentry trace" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5079556/118963250-d7b40980-b998-11eb-9de4-598d1b220137.png">

This feature is activated by default. But users can use the new `config.propagate_traces` config option to disable it.

- Add configuration option `skip_rake_integration` [#1453](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1453)

With this new option, users can skip exceptions reported from rake tasks by setting it `true`. Default is `false`.

### Bug Fixes

- Allow toggling background sending on the fly [#1447](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1447)
- Disable background worker for runner mode [#1448](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/pull/1448)
  - Fixes [#1324](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1324)
